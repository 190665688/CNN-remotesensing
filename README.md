## Code



The study of shrub detection with Google Earth images was based on the projects [by Google developers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) for the Inception model and adaptation of [ResNet-152](https://gist.github.com/flyyufelix/7e2eafb149f72f4d38dd661882c554a6) model used by [Keras]( https://keras.io) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
