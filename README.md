# CNN-remotesensing

Using CNN models (ResNet-152 and Inception v3) to detect shrubs in satellite imagery (Google Earth)

Due to space limitation in Github, the dataset and codes are provided via email request to this email: e.guirado@ual.es and siham@ugr.es


## acknowledgements
The study of shrub detection with Google Earth imagery was based in Google developers for the [Inception](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) model and adaptation of [ResNet-152](https://gist.github.com/flyyufelix/7e2eafb149f72f4d38dd661882c554a6) model used by [Keras]( https://keras.io) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
