# CNN-remotesensing

The study of shrub detection with Google Earth imagery was based on Inception model and  ResNet-152 model using Keras(as front-end) and Tensorflow(as back-end).

Due to space limitation in Github, the dataset and codes are provided via email request to this email: e.guirado@ual.es and siham@ugr.es
