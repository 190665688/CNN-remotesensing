# CNN-remotesensing

Using CNN models (ResNet and Inception v3) to detect shrubs in satellite imagery (Google Earth)

.

.


The study of shrub detection with Google Earth images was based on the projects [by Google developers](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) for the Inception model and adaptation of [ResNet-152](https://github.com/adamcasson/resnet152) model used by [Keras]( https://keras.io) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
